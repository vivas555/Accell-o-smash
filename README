This app is not only mine it was make in collaboration with my friend Phillip Tremblay back in march 2016 for school.

Also, we realised too late that this app CAN'T work on any actual phone since phone's accelerometers aren't actually good enough for it to work.I guess it could works with a vey few minors tweaks if you plug it on your car's accelerometer but I really don't recommend that.
